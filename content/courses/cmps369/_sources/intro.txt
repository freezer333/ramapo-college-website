General Information
########################
Welcome to the online syllabus for CMPS 369.  For students enrolledin the course, lecture slides, assignment submission, and grades will be posted on appiversity.

Course Description
====================================
This course provides in-depth treatment of the critical languages, design patterns, and technologies underpinning all of modern web application development. The basics of networking, along with the details of the HTTP protocol are introduced. HTML (through version 5), CSS (through version 3) are presented from the perspective of an application developer.

JavaScript is covered as the primary language for both client side development (utilizing jQuery and other front-end libraries) and server side (utilizing the node.js library). Advanced JavaScript topics such as closures and asynchronous programming are covered in depth.

The course also introduces the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture for web development and covers the Express framework including EJS and Jade templating. An overview of other popular languages and frameworks such as LESS, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and PHP are also provided to increase the breadth of the students' knowledge in the field.

Note, this course is taught under the assumption that the student has programming knowledge and experience in an object-oriented language such as C++ or Java, as it JavaScript is used extensively throughout the  semester.  The emphasis of this course is web development from an application programmer's perspective.  It is a technical course, not suitable for students without an adequate background in computer science.
