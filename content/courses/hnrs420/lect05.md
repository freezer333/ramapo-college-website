## Reading List
Just a quick note about the links below.  First - Facebook is over-represented, and its just because people write about it more than other companies - especially recently.  While you read these, keep in mind that Facebook is representative - but really shouldn't be singled out.  

I'd also like you to read these with some discretion - while the authors of some of these articles paint a very "big brother" picture, try to consider alternativa ways to look at this as well - we'll be able to have a much more engaging discussion in class this way!
