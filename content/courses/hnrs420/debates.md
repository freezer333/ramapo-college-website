# HNRS 420 Spring 2015

## Debate Schedule
One week before each scheduled debate, I will meet with the teams doing the debate to work on finalizing the organization and topic of the presentation.  Teams are expected to work together, not in secret :-).

You should plan to have your debate nearly completed by the time you meet with me, and your preparedness for this meeting WILL count towards your grade.

## Debate Details
The second part of eight of the lectures include a semi-structured debate.  Students will be paired, and two teams (4 total students) will be expected to frame a debate surrounding the topic assigned.  

The purpose of the team is not only to debate each other, but to be "subject matter" experts and help frame the class's discussion.  Your grade will be based on (1) how well you understand the problem/topic, (2) how persuasively you make your arguments, and (3) how well you get the rest of the class involved in the discussion.

*8 debates, 8 teams.  Each team will have 2 debates.  Teams to be assigned first week of class*
