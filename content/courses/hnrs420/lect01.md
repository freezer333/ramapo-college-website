# HNRS 420 - Lecture 1 Course Introduction<br/><br/>A history of computing, and why you should care!

For our first lecture I will be describing the workings and expectations of the course in detail.  In particular, we will discuss the structure of the lectures, which will include debates and presentations nearly each week, let by students.  

Once the course introduction is out of the way, we'll look at our first topic - a history of computing and why you should care.  In particular, we'll talk about how some of the key innovations have occurred, and who was responsible for them.  We'll also pay particular attention to what's happened right here in NJ - which is perhaps a lot more than you might realize...

## Homework
Debates start in two weeks - [check the debate schedule](debates.html).  You will be paired with another student for both debates that you participate in.  You have your choice in who you are paired with, and on topic - although I can't 100% promise that I'll make it work.

Please contact me about debates ASAP:
1. Who do you want to be paired with?  
1. What topics do you want to debate?  

If you donâ€™t want to be paired with anyone in particular, or cannot present/debate on a specific date - let me know ASAP.

Finally - **PLEASE GET THE TEXTBOOKS ASAP**.
