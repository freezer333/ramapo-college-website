# HNRS 420 - Lecture 2 <br/><br/>The nature of programming, and programmers
In this lecture I'll introduce you to programming, and we'll spend most of our time discussing what software can do, what its like to be a programmer, and what problems exist in the programming profession today.  We'll spend a good deal of time discussing why we have a shortage of talented software developers, and ways in which people have proposed fixing this.

We will also have our first introduction to actually writing some code - please see the homework below.

The Open Source debate group will meet with me during the last portion of the class.
