# Courses @ Ramapo College
I regularly teach eight computer science courses that count toward the CS major, including two coruses that are often offered as 100% online.  I am also teaching in the Ramapo College Honors Program 2015-2016.  Below are the courses I teach, with short descriptions and an idea of when I will teach the next.  For courses that I have a dedicated web page for, links are provided.

## CMPS 130 - Scientific Programming with Python
This course covers common computational approaches to solving scientific problems using the Python programming language.  The first half of the course is dedicated to mastery of the Python language within the context of fundamental computer science topics, such object orientation, algorithmic complexity, recursion, and debugging/testing.  The second half of the course focuses on practical scientific applications of Python in data analysis and experimentation.  Student will develop programs using stochastic models, experimental probability and statistics, Monte Carlo simulation, regression analysis, and dynamic programming.  PyLab, a graphing library similar to MatLab, will be utilized such that students can develop programs to report results using scatter plots, bar graphs, histograms, etc.  

The course is specifically geared towards students with high aptitude in math, science, and critical thinking.  Previous programming experience is recommended, but not required.  The course will provide sufficient introduction to computer programming to the non-major, previous course work in computer science is not required.  The course’s emphasis on numerical problem solving and data analysis, along with the introduction to the Python programming language, makes it a relevant and valuable course for computer science majors at the sophomore/junior level.

*This course will be offered for the first time Summer 2015 as an online course*

## [CMPS 147 - Introduction to Computer Science](cmps147/winter)
An introduction to programming methodology including: basic concepts of computer systems, the programming languages C/C++, algorithm design, program development, implementation, and testing.

*I teach this course frequently, including during both summer and winter sessions online.  This course is offered by CS faculty other than myself in the Spring and Fall on a regular basis as well.*

## [CMPS 148 - Introduction to Computer Science 2](cmps148)
An introduction to programming methodology including:  basic concepts of computer systems, the programming languages C/C++, algorithm design, program development, implementation, and testing.  This course focuses on topics not covered in CMPS 147, specifically Object Oriented Programming, Templates, STL, Exceptions, and the beginnings of data structures such as Linked Lists.

*I teach this course frequently, but not each semester.  This course is offered by CS faculty other than myself on a regular basis as well.*

## [CMPS 231 - Data Structures and Algorithms](cmps231)
A study of the basic data structures and related algorithms used in software development. Lists, stacks, queues, arrays, trees, graphs, strings, sorting, searching, and file structures are among the topics presented in this course.

*I teach this every few years - the last time I offered a section was Fall 2014.  This course is offered by CS faculty other than myself on a regular basis as well.*


## [CMPS 311 - Operating Systems](cmps311)
A study of the design, use, and analysis of operating systems. The course will include a study of the supportive computer architecture, memory management, process management, information management, device control, operating systems structure, and evaluation.  

*I teach this each spring semester*

## CMPS 342 - Computer Graphics

*I teach this each every three semesters (typically) - this course will next be offered Spring 2016*

## [CMPS 364 - Database Systems](cmps364)

This course provides in-depth treatment of relational database design, the Structured Query Language (SQL), along with non-traditional databases such as key and document stores.

The first portion of the semester is dedicated to relational schema design, emphasizing normalization, ER and UML modeling, and aspects of the SQL DDL for creating constraints and relationships between data models.
The second segment of the semester is focused on SQL and query design. We will use the H2 database through the Java programming language, utilizing JDBC.

The third portion of the class is dedicated to a variety of different technologies related to data representation, storage, and retieval. This includes XML/XSLT, JSON and MongoDB, and the Redis key-store database.
While the course will include discussions on database security, data protection, and administration, the primary focus of the course is software development using databases.

*I teach this each every three semesters (typically) - this course will next be offered Spring 2015*

## [CMPS 369 - Web Application Development](cmps369)
This course provides in-depth treatment of the critical languages, design patterns, and technologies underpinning all of modern web application development. The basics of networking, along with the details of the HTTP protocol are introduced. HTML (through version 5), CSS (through version 3) are presented from the perspective of an application developer.

JavaScript is covered as the primary language for both client side development (utilizing jQuery and other front-end libraries) and server side (utilizing the node.js library). Advanced JavaScript topics such as closures and asynchronous programming are covered in depth.

The course also introduces the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture for web development and covers the Express framework including EJS and Jade templating. An overview of other popular languages and frameworks such as LESS, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and PHP are also provided to increase the breadth of the students’ knowledge in the field.
Note, this course is taught under the assumption that the student has programming knowledge and experience in an object-oriented language such as C++ or Java, as it JavaScript is used extensively throughout the semester. The emphasis of this course is web development from an application programmer’s perspective. It is a technical course, not suitable for students without an adequate background in computer science.

*I teach this each every three semesters (typically) - this course will next be offered Fall 2015*

## [HNRS 420 - Computation and Society](hnrs420)
The focus of this course is the exploration of how computers have, and continue to transform our society. The course will begin with a historical, and hands-on study of how a computer and the software that drives it is created, including a topical treatment of programming to familiarize the student with computing. The course will then focus on the major innovations that computing is enabling in our society, and how these impact economics, ethics, and law. This will include topics such as hacking and identity/financial fraud, crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, data mining and privacy issues, and the effects of automation and computerization on economic and social imbalances. This course does not assume any previous experience in computer programming.

*This course will be offered in the Spring of 2015 and Spring of 2015.  It is only available for students in the Ramapo College Honors program.*
