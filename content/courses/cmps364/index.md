## Course Description
This course provides in-depth treatment of relational database design, the Structured Query Language (SQL), along with non-traditional databases such as key and document stores.
The first portion of the semester is dedicated to relational schema design, emphasizing normalization, ER and UML modeling, and aspects of the SQL DDL for creating constraints and relationships between data models.
The second segment of the semester is focused on SQL and query design. We will use the H2 database through the Java programming language, utilizing JDBC.
The third portion of the class is dedicated to a variety of different technologies related to data representation, storage, and retieval. This includes XML/XSLT, JSON and MongoDB, and the Redis key-store database.
While the course will include discussions on database security, data protection, and administration, the primary focus of the course is software development using databases.
## Pre-Requisites

CMPS 231 Data Structures

## Course Materials

**Textbook** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Database Systems - The Complete Book - 2nd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Database-Systems-Complete-Book-Edition/dp/0131873253) by Garcia-Molina, Ullman, Widom

*Note, the textbook is required for this course, and will be relavent to nearly each lecture.*

## Programming Environment
This course will require you to write SQL and Java code. A simple text editor is all that is necessary, however installing a good programming editor is highly recommended. In addition, you will also need to install H2. H2 is a Java-based database implementation which is compatable with all major operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) as long as Java has been installed on the system.  It is highly recommended that you have access to your own computer to do your development on.

When we begin programming with Java, you are encouraged to download [eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). Please make sure you download and install the newest version of the standard edition (or the another more specialized edition). We will go over the creation of programs in eclipse during class time.

## Course Objectives
* Theoretical basis for relational database design* Entity Relationship Diagrams* UML Diagrams* Structured Query Language (SQL)* Advanced RDBMS topics such as* Constraints and Triggers* Views* Index implementation* Programming against Databases using Java (JDBC, JPA)* XML and XPATH/XSLT* Use of Document-store database (MongoDB)## Lecture Schedule
Below is a tentative schedule for the course.  All topics and due dates are subject to change, and if there is a difference between what is stated here and on Moodle, please always consider Moodle to be correct (and let me know so I can correct the mismatch!).
